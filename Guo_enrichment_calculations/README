### enrichment estimation
bedwin100.R - R script uses UCSC canonical genes and GENCODE gene lists to create a bed file from gene starts to ends with each window classed as exonic or intronic depending on which element it most overlaps.
intersect.sh - this counts reads per window for each sample - mouse and human read separately - also adds a header stating the total read count
paster.sh - for subsequent analyses, files with CLAP sample reads per window and merged +tag or -tag Input reads per window are combined in the same file.  
binomTables.R -  calculates enrichment scores and p-values from the number of reads per window and total number of mapped reads in CLAP and merged Input samples
plotter_loops.R - plots enrichment vs Input read counts for each window (Fig1)  and generates UpSet plots of intersections of enriched windows between CLAP samples
xistplotter.R - plots enrichment along mature XIST RNA (Fig S1)
### Homer
Homer.sh - the HOMER command run on  enriched windows. 100K random windows were used as background.
